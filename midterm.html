          <b>Coffee preparation </b>is the process of turning coffee beans into
          a beverage. While the particular steps vary with the type of coffee
          and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic steps; raw
          coffee beans must be roasted, the roasted coffee beans must then be
          ground, the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot water for a
          certain time (brewed), and finally the liquid coffee must be separated
          from the used grounds. Coffee is usually brewed immediately before
          drinking. In most areas, coffee may be purchased unprocessed, or
          already roasted, or already roasted and ground. Coffee is often vacuum
          packed to prevent oxidation and lengthen its shelf life.

      <div class="box">
        <img class="roast" src="roasting.jpeg" alt="" />
        <p>
          <b>Roasting coffee:</b> transforms the chemical and physical
          properties of green coffee beans. When roasted, the green coffee bean
          expands to nearly double its original size, changing in color and
          density. As the bean absorbs heat, its color shifts to yellow, then to
          a light "cinnamon" brown, and then to a rich dark brown color. During
          roasting, oils appear on the surface of the bean. The roast will
          continue to darken until it is removed from the heat source. Coffee
          can be roasted with ordinary kitchen equipment (frying pan, grill,
          oven, popcorn popper) or by specialised appliances. A coffee roaster
          is a special pan or apparatus suitable to heat up and roast green
          coffee beans. The vast majority of coffee is roasted commercially on a
          large scale, but small-scale commercial roasting has grown
          significantly with the trend toward "single-origin" coffees served at
          specialty shops. Some coffee drinkers even roast coffee at home as a
          hobby in order to both experiment with the flavor profile of the beans
          and ensure themselves of the freshest possible roast.

      <h1 class="grind">grinding method</h1>

      <div class="box">
        <p>
          The whole coffee beans are ground, also known as milling, to
          facilitate the brewing process. The fineness of the grind strongly
          affects brewing. Brewing methods that expose coffee grounds to heated
          water for longer require a coarser grind than faster brewing methods.
          Beans that are too finely ground for the brewing method in which they
          are used will expose too much surface area to the heated water and
          produce a bitter, harsh, "over-extracted" taste. At the other extreme,
          an overly coarse grind will produce weak coffee unless more is used.
          Due to the importance of a grind's fineness, a uniform grind is highly
          desirable. If a brewing method is used in which the time of exposure
          of the ground coffee to the heated water is adjustable, then a short
          brewing time can be used for finely ground coffee. This produces
          coffee of equal flavor yet uses less ground coffee. A blade grinder
          does not cause frictional heat buildup in the ground coffee unless
          used to grind very large amounts as in a commercial operation. A fine
          grind allows the most efficient extraction but coffee ground too
          finely will slow down filtration or screening. Ground coffee
          deteriorates faster than roasted beans because of the greater surface
          area exposed to oxygen. Many coffee drinkers grind the beans
          themselves immediately before brewing.

            In percolation, the water passes through the coffee grounds, gaining
            soluble compounds to form coffee. Insoluble compounds remain within
            the coffee filter. Coffee can be brewed in several different ways,
            but these methods fall into four main groups depending on how the
            water is introduced to the coffee grounds: decoction (through
            boiling), infusion (through steeping), gravitational feed (used with
            percolators and in drip brewing), or pressurized percolation (as
            with espresso).
            <br />
            Brewed coffee, if kept hot, will deteriorate rapidly in flavor, and
            reheating such coffee tends to give it a "muddy" flavour, as some
            compounds that impart flavor to coffee are destroyed if this is
            done. Even at room temperature, deterioration will occur; however,
            if kept in an oxygen-free environment it can last almost
            indefinitely at room temperature, and sealed containers of brewed
            coffee are sometimes commercially available in food stores in
            America or Europe, with refrigerated bottled coffee drinks being
            commonly available at convenience stores and grocery stores in the
            United States. Canned coffee is particularly popular in Japan and
            South Korea.

        <div class="content">
          <b>Boiling</b> or decoction, was the main method used for brewing
          coffee until the 1930s and is still used in some Nordic and Middle
          Eastern countries. The aromatic oils in coffee are released at 96 °C
          (205 °F), which is just below boiling, while the bitter acids are
          released when the water has reached boiling point.
          <br />
          The simplest method is to put the ground coffee in a cup, pour hot
          water over it and let cool while the grounds sink to the bottom. This
          is a traditional method for making a cup of coffee that is still used
          in parts of Indonesia. This method, known as "mud coffee" in the
          Middle East owing to an extremely fine grind that results in a
          mud-like sludge at the bottom of the cup, allows for extremely simple
          preparation, but drinkers then have to be careful if they want to
          avoid drinking grounds either from this layer or floating at the
          surface of the coffee, which can be avoided by dribbling cold water
          onto the "floaters" from the back of a spoon. If the coffee beans are
          not ground finely enough, the grounds do not sink.
          <br />
          "Cowboy coffee" is made by heating coarse grounds with water in a pot,
          letting the grounds settle and pouring off the liquid to drink,
          sometimes filtering it to remove fine grounds. While the name suggests
          that this method was used by cowboys, presumably on the trail around a
          campfire, it is used by others; some people prefer this method.

          A cafetière, or French press, is a tall, narrow cylinder with a
          plunger that includes a metal or nylon fine mesh filter. The grounds
          are placed in the cylinder, and off-the- boil water is then poured
          into it. The coffee and hot water are left in the cylinder for a few
          minutes (typically 4–7 minutes) and then the plunger is gently pushed
          down, leaving the filter immediately above the grounds, allowing the
          coffee to be poured out while the filter retains the grounds.
          Depending on the type of filter, it is important to pay attention to
          the grind of the coffee beans, though a rather coarse grind is almost
          always called for.
          <br />
          Malaysian and some Caribbean and South American styles of coffee are
          often brewed using a "sock," which is actually a simple muslin bag,
          shaped like a filter, into which coffee is loaded, then steeped in hot
          water. This method is especially suitable for use with local-brew
          coffees in Malaysia, primarily of the varieties Robusta and Liberica
          which are often strong-flavored, allowing the ground coffee in the
          sock to be reused.
